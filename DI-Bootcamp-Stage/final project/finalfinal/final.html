                <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Ben Gurions life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1886</strong>- Born in Russian Empire-controlled Płońsk. son of Victor Gruen, one of the leaders in Płońsk of the “Lovers of Zion,” a movement that was disseminating among the oppressed Jews of eastern Europe the idea of the return to their original homeland of Israel. </li>
                    <li><strong>1906</strong>- At the age of 20, moved to Palestine and for several years worked as a farmer in the Jewish agricultural settlements in the coastal plain and in Galilee</li>
                    <li><strong>1914</strong>- With the outbreak of World War I, the Turkish governors of Palestine, their suspicions aroused by his Zionist activity, arrested Ben-Gurion and expelled him from the Ottoman Empire. During the height of the war, he traveled to New York, where he met and eventually married the Russian-born Pauline Munweis.</li>
                    <li><strong>1917</strong>- Balfour Declaration, which promised the Jews a “national home” in Palestine, Ben-Gurion enlisted in the British army’s Jewish Legion and sailed back to the Middle East to join the war for the liberation of Palestine from Ottoman rule.</li>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong>- Britain changed its Middle East policy, abandoning its sympathetic stand toward the Jews and adopting a sympathetic attitude toward the Arabs, leading to severe restrictions on Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Ben-Gurion reacted by calling upon the Jewish community to rise against England, thus heralding the decade of “fighting Zionism.”</li>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong>- Ben Gurion assembled an emergency conference of American Zionists in New York City; the convention decided upon the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine after the war. At the end of World War II, Ben-Gurion again led the Jewish community in its successful struggle against the British mandate</li>
                    <li><strong>1948</strong>- in accordance with a decision of the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of the United States and the Soviet Union, the State of Israel was established.</li>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong>- Ben-Gurion retired from the Knesset and from all political activity, devoting himself to the writing of his memoirs in Sde-Boqer, a kibbutz in the Negev. He published a number of books, mostly collections of speeches and essays. Through most of his life he had also engaged in researches into the history of the Jewish community in Palestine and in the study of the Bible.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Ben-Gurion viewed the newborn state as the direct continuation of Jewish history that, in his opinion, had been interrupted 2,000 years earlier when the Roman legions had crushed the Hebrew freedom fighters and banished the Jews from Palestine. He saw the Jews’ period of exile as a prolonged interlude in the history of Israel and declared that they had now regained their rightful home. In order to strengthen and develop the young nation, Ben-Gurion presented the people of Israel with a series of challenges: the absorption of mass immigration from all over the world; the assimilation of newcomers of diverse communities and backgrounds; the creation of a unified public education system; the settlement of the desert lands. In his foreign policy, he adopted an independent and pragmatic course. He used to say: “What matters is not what the Gentiles will say, but what the Jews will do.” His defense policy was firm, and he answered violations of the cease-fire agreements by neighbouring Arab states with military reprisals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ben Gurion's stronghanded policy inspired little sympathy for him from the governments of the United States and Britain. They preferred more moderate leaders such as Chaim Weizmann, first president of Israel, and Moshe Sharett, who was elected prime minister for a brief term (1953–55) when Ben-Gurion temporarily retired from office. Striving to gain a foothold in the Middle East, the U.S.S.R. alienated Israel by providing the Arabs with vast quantities of arms. At that time, Ben-Gurion found an ally in France. During the war in Algeria, France encountered the opposition of the united Arab front, led by Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser, and consequently drew closer to Israel, supplying it with considerable amounts of military equipment; when Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in July 1956, French initiative brought Israel to join the Franco-British military campaign against Egypt. On October 29, 1956, following a secret visit to France and a meeting with French and British leaders, Ben-Gurion ordered the army to take over the Sinai Peninsula, while France and Britain were making an abortive attempt to seize the canal. Israel subsequently withdrew from Sinai after having been assured freedom of navigation in the Strait of Tiran and de facto peace along the Egyptian-Israeli border, which was to be supervised by a special United Nations force.</p>

                    <li><strong>He formed a youth club at the age of 14</strong>
                        <article>Together with his friends, Ben-Gurion formed a youth club called Ezra. The youth club promoted Hebrew studies and emigration to the Holy Land. It ran Hebrew classes for local youths, and in 1903, the club collected funds for the victims of the Kishinev pogrom. Ezra had 150 members within a year. This was the beginning of the Zionist belief and movement in Ben-Gurion who later on led the Jews back to Palestine.</article>

                        <article>Ben-Gurion went to Thessalonika to learn Turkish in 1911. He went to Thessalonika because it was way more affordable than studying Turkish in Istanbul. He was taught by Joseph Strumsa, a law student and he learned the language in under 8 months. This was in his preparation to study law. A year later in 1912, he was studying law in Istanbul. He registered as David Gruen Efendi at the university to escape financial constraints. World War One broke out cutting short his studies in Istanbul.</article>
